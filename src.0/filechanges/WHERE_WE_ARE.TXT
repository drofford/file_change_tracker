==========

So there are big problems here:

* the code does not pass back the retrieved hash value from the database;
* the code compares the calculated MD5 with itself, so no files change;
* the problems are in the functions:
  - corecursor
  - md5indb
  - haschanged

I think I need to redo the code.
